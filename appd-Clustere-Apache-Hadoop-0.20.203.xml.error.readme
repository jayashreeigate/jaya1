There was an error importing the blueprint.This may have been caused by common issues such as:

* Using an incorrect URL. You must have your vFabric Application Director installed then a typical URL will look similar to http://<AppDir Host>:8080 or https://<AppDir Host>:8443
* Using an unsuported web browser. Only Chrome and Firefox have the required features for this page to work. If these browers are not available, you can always manually import the solution. See the end of this message for more information.
* Network access issues. This page needs to be able to acces the publib internet and also access the vFabric Application Director host.
* Browser security settings. This page uses javascript heavily and will not work without it.
* Please make sure you are using the correct version of application director.
* To troubleshoot issues during import you can try to manually download the blueprint(click on the "Download File" button, and save the solution XML) and import using the Application Director CLI.
* For more information on how to use the Application Director CLI refer to the Application Director documentation.
 Use the vFabric Application Director darwin-cli.jar to import the solution XML with the "import-package" command.
